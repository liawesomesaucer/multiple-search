# Multiple Search: v1.1

Multiple Search allows you to have all your search bars on one page. 

#### Get a newtab extension that autoredirects to this page or set this as your homepage
- Javascript is required for this to work.
- Cookies are required to remember preferences (in web versions)

#### How to make it work
A working link is available [here](http://liawesomesaucer.github.io/multiple-search/), hosted with gh-pages
- Online version uses cookies to remember preferences and will set defaults if no cookies are found
- Just redirect to/bookmark that page.

*OR* you can fork the repo and configure it locally
Two important configuration files
- colors.js - handles colors; you can select color schemes, and create your own if you'd like.
- formhandler.js - handles forms, cookies, etc

#### Upcoming features
- *Color Schemes* - change colors from the webpage
- *Custom URLs* - add your own search URLs
