# Multiple Search - have multiple search bars
v1.0

I recommend getting a newtab extension that autoredirects to this page
-Redirect to index.html.
-Javascript is required for this to work.

An online link is available at http://liawesomesaucer.github.io/multiple-search/
-Just redirect/bookmark to that page.

Individual configurations
colors.js - handles colors; you can select color schemes, and create your own if you'd like.
formhandler.js - configurations for what search bars you'd like.  Uncomment to have it display; comment to hide.

Todos: adding a sidebar for setting configuration; using cookies to store settings.
